## Script to install basic linux packages / libraries and essential programs.
Whenever you change your ubuntu version, do you face difficulties
in remembering what packages do I need to install?  
I have made a script to install the basic packages that everyone 
needs after a fresh install.  
I update this script whenever I feel I am installing a necessary package and just run this script with every fresh
install of linux.

## Feel free to use it for yourself :)
